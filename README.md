This is an exploratory undergraduate project that I plan to do in my spare time. I'm open to any recommendations but I can't promise that I will be able to respond in a reasonable time.

My goal is to create specific queries in chatGPT in order to see if it can play chess, and if so, at which level.

My plan is to use python computer vision libraries in order to interract with  "chess.com" (hence the use of Python instead of C# or Java). This data will later be fed into chatGPT using the DaVinci API. The initial budget is 50â‚º which should be enough with 2c/40kr per 1k tokens for DaVinci.
